#### Objective: 

To create an interactive dashboard in Power BI that provides a comprehensive analysis of superstore sales data, highlighting key performance metrics, trends, and actionable insights to aid in decision-making.

#### Description:

Developed a comprehensive sales dashboard in Power BI. Imported and cleaned sales data, created calculated columns and measures, and designed various visualizations (line charts, bar charts, pie charts, maps). Implemented interactive features such as slicers, filters, tooltips, and drill-throughs. Presented key insights into sales trends, regional performance, product analysis, and customer segments.

#### Tools and Techniques:

Power BI: 

Data import, data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard creation.

Data Visualization: 

Line charts, bar charts, pie charts, maps, treemaps, slicers, filters, tooltips, and drill-throughs.

#### Key Steps and Details:
##### Data Collection and Preparation:

Data Source: 

Extracted sales data from a superstore dataset, typically includes fields such as order date, sales, profit, customer segment, region, product category, and sub-category.

Data Cleaning:

Imported the dataset into Power BI.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in date formats and categorical data.

##### Data Modeling:

Relationships: 

Established relationships between tables (e.g., orders, customers, products, and regions) to enable comprehensive analysis.

Calculated Columns and Measures: 

Created calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to perform custom calculations and aggregations such as total sales, total profit, profit margin, and sales growth.

##### Dashboard Design:

###### KPIs: 
Displayed key performance indicators such as total sales, total profit, average order value, and profit margin.

###### Sales Analysis:

By Time: Visualized sales trends over time using line charts to show monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales.

By Region: Used maps and bar charts to analyze sales distribution across different regions.

By Category: Employed stacked bar charts and treemaps to display sales and profit by product category and sub-category.

By Segment: Showed sales performance by customer segment using pie charts and clustered bar charts.

##### Data Visualization:

Visual Consistency: Ensured consistent use of colors, fonts, and layout to enhance readability and user experience.

##### Outcome:

This project showcased my ability to leverage Power BI for advanced data visualization and analysis. The interactive dashboard provided valuable insights into sales performance, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to enhance business strategy and operations.
